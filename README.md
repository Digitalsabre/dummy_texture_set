# Dummy Texture Set #

I now present to the world the Dummy Texture Set, with features designed to make use easy.

Block textures come in transparent and opaque, in three outline colors, lettered from A-Z for each block side (up, north, east, south, west, and down).  Each block side is clearly marked with symbols identifying its side.

26 lettered item textures are also a part of this texture set.

This is not a texture pack.  It is a set of textures designed specifically for Minecraft mod coders to insert into projects while coding, so that they do not have to worry about modeling their own textures.

## Benefits ##
Code your blocks without setting aside the code itself.  Add these dummy textures as needed to your project with the appropriate block or item names, and the replace them when actual textures become available.

* Don't distract yourself from the meat of your project while working on fluff.
* Leave the assets declared but undefined so you can still test without fumbling with pixel art.
* Provide names and positions for your artist or art team to replace as art material becomes available.

## Features ##
* Three primary colors:

* Opaque and Transparent (transparent not yet implemented)
* Side identifiers are based on a cardinal cross, which is meant to represent the faces of an unfolded cube: 
 * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/up.png) Up is kept in the center of the cardinal cross to help make it easier to identify North.
 * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/north.png) North is at the top as in a compass rose.
 * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/west.png) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/east.png) West and East also correspond to their relative positions on a compass rose.
 * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/south.png) South is placed relative to North on the cardinal cross, as it would appear on a compass rose.
 * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/down.png) Down appears at the bottom of the cardinal cross, relative to where it would appear on an actual cube in relation to Up.
 * Finally, ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digitalsabre/dummy_texture_set/master/README%20assets/sides.png) Side represents a texture which will be used on all sides of a block, and it is shown with all four compass rose points.
